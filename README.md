# Naive-Bayes-vs-Support-Vector-Machine-classifiers

Assignment 1 of the Machine Learning course of Nova School of Science and technology.

The goal of this assignment is to parametrize, fit and compare Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The data set is inspired on the banknote authentication problem in the UCI machine learning repository, but the data was adapted for this assignment.
